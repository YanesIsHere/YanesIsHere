- 👋 Hi, I’m @YanesIsHere - or Yanes, for short. Not my real name, but just go with it. Long story. 
- 👀 I’m interested in web3 development, smart contracts and such. I'll admit I'm not that smart.
- 🌱 I’m dusting off on coding in general! Used to work in databases and related utilities - but once a geek, always a geek.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on web3 projects - give me some time to learn. 
- 📫 How to reach me... Github knows how. Hope to hear from you soon!
